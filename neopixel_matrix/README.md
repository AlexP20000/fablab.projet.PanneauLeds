This library turns a strip of NeoPixels into a 2D matrix. It can also display and scroll text.

There exists a [Python library for Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi) to control the individual NeoPixels on a strip. However I could not find support for more than that, specifically not for 2D screen and text display. Thus, I wrote a Python library.
